This project turned out to be more of a challenge than we initally thought.
Creating the inital version went very well, we knew how we wanted to accomplish most t
hings from the writeup in lab 8. We got the pieces moving around the board with ease, 
but debugging the edge cases took some time. For example, when doing a double jump 
everything was working fine, but upon trying a second double jump things didn't seem right.
We realized this was because we weren't clearing the jumpAgainOptions vector, 
and it was using values that were previously put in it. Another roadblock 
we ran into was github not working/ not being able to compile on the Hydra Telsa machines.
The proffessor said that it was fine to just show it working in person, so we decided not to 
investigate the hydra tesla machines too much. After too nuch time trying to get github to 
work on one computer, we decided to do the project together on one computer.
