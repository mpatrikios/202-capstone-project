This is a checkers game that uses a 2-d array. Run in VScode (not on hydra) with command "g++ -std=c++11 -o checkers Checkers.cpp main.cpp" and "./checkers". Input is the row/column of the peice you want to move and the direction to move given by the key. The X/O side are labeled because once you king a peice, you will enter a "backwards" command to move towards your side and "forward" command to move towards the enemy side. If a double jump is available, you will be prompted to jump again if you wish.
